# A very basic implementation of coroutines

This is a small C file to understand the idea behind co-routines
This code was lifted off from 

brennan.io/2020/05/24/userspace-cooperative-multitasking/ and from various sources on the internet. 

I do not claim to have done this work originally

I merely copy-pasted the code and added links to various web documents  that I used to understand how co-routines work, what is inline asm and generic lists in C.

If you think I missed an attribution somewhere,please let me know so that I can attribute it to the original author
